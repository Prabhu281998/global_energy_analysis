/* Observations from the Data:
Fluctuating Trend:

Energy consumption increased from 2000 to 2007, reaching a peak in 2007 (2,164,026 TWh).
It dropped in 2010 (1,694,138 TWh), likely due to economic downturns (e.g., the 2008 global financial crisis).
Consumption recovered after 2010, peaking again in 2014 (2,247,936 TWh).
Recent Decline (2020-2024):

2020 (COVID-19 pandemic) saw the highest consumption (2,258,586 TWh)â€”possibly due to increased energy use in homes.
A steady decline is observed after 2021, reaching 1,888,162 TWh in 2024.
This could indicate higher efficiency, renewable energy adoption, or economic slowdowns.

Australia (227,091 TWh) follows, likely due to mining, heavy industries, and extreme climate conditions requiring high energy usage.
Russia (215,712 TWh) has high consumption, likely due to its large industrial sector, energy exports, and cold climate.
Canada (211,405 TWh) is another high consumer, with large industrial sectors (oil, gas, and manufacturing) and heating demands.
China (202,998 TWh) appears in the top 5, despite being a global manufacturing hub. This could be due to energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy adoption.

ðŸ”¹ Industrial Operations Adjustments: Some industries ramped up production, while others remained operational at reduced efficiency.
ðŸ”¹ Higher Digital Energy Demand: More internet usage, cloud computing, and streaming services surged energy consumption.

Possible Reasons for Brazil's High Per Capita Energy Use in 2024:
ðŸ”¹ Industrial Growth: Brazil has a strong industrial sector, including manufacturing, mining, and agriculture processing.
ðŸ”¹ Hydropower Dominance: A large share of Brazilâ€™s energy comes from hydroelectric power, making energy more accessible.
ðŸ”¹ Population vs. Energy Ratio: With a relatively stable population and increasing energy demand, the per capita figure rises.
ðŸ”¹ Urbanization & Infrastructure Growth: More cities expanding, leading to higher residential and commercial energy use.
