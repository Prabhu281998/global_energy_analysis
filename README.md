# 🌍 Global Energy Consumption Analysis  
This project analyzes worldwide energy consumption trends, carbon emissions, and renewable energy adoption using SQL.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Cleaned and analyzed global energy data using SQL  
- Identified missing values and duplicates  
- Aggregated data for better insights  
- Created a consolidated dataset for visualization  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [Mention source or upload sample data]  
- Data includes total energy consumption, per capita use, renewable energy share, fossil fuel dependency, and carbon emissions  

## 🔍 SQL Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Exploration**: Checking structure, null values, and duplicates  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
3. **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing energy consumption and emissions by country and year  
4. **Data Storage**: Creating a new consolidated table for better analysis  

## 📜 SQL Queries  
All SQL queries used in this project are available in the [queries](queries/) folder.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Countries with the highest carbon emissions  
- Renewable energy adoption trends over time  
- Industrial vs. household energy consumption patterns
