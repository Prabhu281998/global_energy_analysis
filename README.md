# 🌍 Global Energy Consumption Analysis  
This project analyzes worldwide energy consumption trends, carbon emissions, and renewable energy adoption using SQL.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Cleaned and analyzed global energy data using SQL  
- Identified missing values and duplicates  
- Aggregated data for better insights  
- Created a consolidated dataset for visualization  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [www.kaggle.com ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-energy-consumption-2000-2024/data)
- Data includes total energy consumption, per capita use, renewable energy share, fossil fuel dependency, and carbon emissions  

## 🔍 SQL Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Exploration**: Checking structure, null values, and duplicates  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
3. **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing energy consumption and emissions by country and year  
4. **Data Storage**: Creating a new consolidated table for better analysis  

## 📜 SQL Queries  
All SQL queries used in this project are available in the Queries folder.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- What is the total energy consumption trend over the years? 
- Which 5 countries consume the most energy in the latest available year?
- Which year recorded the highest energy consumption globally?
- Which country had the highest per capita energy consumption in the latest year?
- What is the trend of renewable energy adoption globally?
